[![dockeri.co](http://dockeri.co/image/lzachmann/es-toolkit)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lzachmann/es-toolkit/)

A mashup of the Rocker Project's [Docker-based Geospatial toolkit for R](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial/), which itself is built on top of a version-stable 'verse' image (for R version 3.4.1), with additional layers for [RStan](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/rstan), [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), [lme4](https://github.com/lme4/lme4), a few other graphics and publishing libraries, the [Earth Engine Python API](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api), and [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo).

_Note: Rocker's 'verse' image contains Base R, RStudio Server, tidyverse components, devtools, publishing packages, and geospatial packages._
